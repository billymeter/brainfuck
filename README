Fuzyll's Challenge of the Nao #1
********************************

Your first challenge, should you choose to accept it, is to write your
own Brainfuck interpreter:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck

- Your interpreter should include all 8 Brainfuck commands (+ - . , < > [ ])
- Your interpreter should use the reference implementation (referred
to in the article as the "classic distribution") of the Brainfuck
environment (IP, DP, 30K 8-bit Cells, etc)
- Your interpreter should successfully interpret the example programs
on the above page (Hello, World! and ROT13) with NO errors
- Your interpreter should use a command-line argument to load a
program (./mybrainfuckinterpreter <program.fuck>)

Questions can be asked freely in our IRC channel.  Submissions may be
sent to my email or as a private message on IRC.  I would prefer
everyone using GitHub to host their code (in which case, you can just
send me a link once you've pushed), but GitHub is not required.

You may look at other implementations of Brainfuck if you'd like, but
realize that the only person you're hurting by taking a shortcut on
this challenge is yourself.  Learning is in the journey, not the
destination.
